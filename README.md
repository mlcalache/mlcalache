- Hi, I am Matheus.
- I’m interested in web software development, focused on back-end and sofware integrations via APIs; team management and coaching; teaching, lecturing, and training; agile methodologies and Scrum framework.
- I’m currently deep learning about information security and ISO27001 standards.
- I’m looking to collaborate on cyber security on back-end development and making sure APIs are exposed in a secure way.
